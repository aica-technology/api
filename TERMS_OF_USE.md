Important: Your Use of AICA Software is Governed by These Legally Binding Terms

Welcome to the AICA System. Before you access or use any AICA software, including but not limited to AICA Core, AICA

read and agree to these User Terms of Use ("User Terms").

These User Terms are a legally binding agreement between You and AICA SA ("AICA"). Your right to use the Software is

acknowledge that You have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these User Terms. If You do not agree, do not
install, copy, access, or use the Software.
