# Getting started

:::caution

The AICA framework is being distributed in a limited beta program. Installation, configuration and run-time instructions
are subject to breaking changes in the near future. We will endeavour to keep this documentation up-to-date with the
latest versions. In case of doubt, contact support@aica.tech for help.

<!-- TODO: write more guides for demo applications:
- Using an interactive marker with RViz
- Using a hardware + controller with a mock interface
- Using the generic interface with a simulator
- Using a real robot
-->
