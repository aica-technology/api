# Licensing

A valid AICA System License is required to access and use AICA System software. Holders of an AICA System License can
also request a Deployment Key for unrestricted offline usage rights of specific deployments.

## AICA System License

A license regulates both the access rights to download AICA software packages and the usage rights to run AICA
applications. To request an AICA System License, contact the AICA sales team at contact@aica.tech. Each new user will
receive access instructions to a personal account for the [AICA license manager](https://licensing.aica.tech/list) which
lists all licenses associated with that user. Every license has a name, an expiration date, the actual license key and a
list of entitlements. At the [AICA package registry](https://registry.licensing.aica.tech/) the user can see all
available packages for one specific license.

:::tip

An AICA System license includes specific entitlements that determine which add-on packages and versions can be accessed
and used. To discover and access additional components and hardware collections, contact your AICA representative to
upgrade your license.

:::

:::caution

Your license key should be kept secret. Do not share your license key with unauthorized users or enter it on websites
other than the official AICA domain. License abuse may prevent your application from running or lead to your license
being revoked.

If an unauthorized user has gained access to your license key, contact support@aica.tech to reset your license.

:::

:::info

- AICA System Licenses are online and require an active internet connection for the entire duration of the application.
- An AICA System License can be used on any machine, but only one instance can be running at any one time.

:::

An AICA System License will appear in the following format, though the specific license key will be unique for each
user.

```toml title="aica-license.toml"
License = "5614D1-3E7A6C-932DEB-8C4189-F6B0F2-V3"
```

## Deployment Keys

Once ready, you can deploy your applications seamlessly into production or purchase a pre-built solution with a one-time
Deployment Key. Deployment Keys are offline with no limitations on consecutive activation time, offering the reliability
and performance needed in a production environment.
