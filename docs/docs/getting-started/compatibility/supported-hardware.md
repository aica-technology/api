# Supported hardware

The AICA System supports many different types of manipulators and sensors. The following tables present these supported
devices, along with necessary prerequisites and additional software that these might require.

:::tip

AICA's Camera Streamer component available in the `components/core-vision` collection can be used to stream images from
any camera that can be natively mounted as a USB device by the host machine. It may also be used with video files. In
cases where the camera is not otherwise supported, a pre-recorded file may be supplied to the component, provided the
application permits it.
