# Supported hardware

The AICA System supports many different types of hardware. The following tables present robotic manipulators and
peripherals for which drivers exist, along with necessary prerequisites and additional software that these might
require.

:::note

This list is work in progress and regularly updated. If your hardware is not listed, please submit a ticket to the  
[AICA Community Feedback board](https://github.com/aica-technology/community) or reach out to the AICA team for
assistance or further details.

As described in [this section](../../concepts/ros-concepts/built-on-ros.md), the AICA System can integrate existing ROS
drivers. This allows you to expand the supported hardware list by using open source or custom-developed ROS packages.

:::tip

You can also use generic cameras and webcams with the Camera Streamer from the `core-vision` components package,
provided your host machine can natively mount them as USB devices.
