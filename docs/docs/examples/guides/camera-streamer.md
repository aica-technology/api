# CameraStreamer camera component

AICA's `core-vision` package includes, among others, the `CameraStreamer` component that can read image streams from
USB devices, network streams, or video files. Most of the standard consumer-grade webcams and video formats are
supported out-of-the-box.

This guide shows the basics on how to use the component with a camera.

:::tip

Working with a video file or network stream is also possible by providing the filepath or network address instead
of a camera device.

:::

## AICA Launcher configuration

Start AICA Launcher, select AICA Core v4.4.2 or higher, and add the `core-vision` package to your configuration.

Select **Launch AICA Studio** to proceed.

## Using the CameraStreamer

Start by creating a new application.

1. Remove the hardware interface that is included in new applications by default.
2. From the `Scene` menu, use the `Add Component` tab and look for the **Camera Streamer** component either by searching
or by manually going under the `Core Vision Components` menu. Click to add it to the graph.
3. Next, connect the component to the start block.
4. Enable **auto-configure** and **auto-activate**.
5. With your new component selected, make sure you are in the `Scene` menu, where you may find all the available
component parameters.

By this point, you should have something like the following:

<div class="text--center">
  <img src={cameraStreamerExample} alt="Default CameraStreamer configuration" />
</div>

Before pressing play, let us go through the parameters first. You should see:

- **Rate**: This is the component's rate, but it has no effect on the operation of `CameraStreamer`.
- **Source**: Path to the source device or video file. If using a camera, this is typically of the form `/dev/videoX`,
whereas for video files you need to provide the absolute path to the video, e.g., `/path/to/video`.
- **Camera frame**: The reference frame that will be used when publishing image messages, which should correspond the
camera's sensor position.
- **Camera configuration**: A YAML-formatted camera configuration file containing the camera intrinsics (optional). If
you don't have a calibration file for your camera, you can follow our [calibration guide](./camera-calibration.md).
- **Frame width**: The desired image width.
- **Frame height**: The desired image height.
- **Frame rate**: The desired frame rate for image streaming.
- **Crop undistorted image**: If a camera configuration file is available, this option indicates whether black-pixel
regions created at the edges of the image post-undistortion should be cropped. Mind that this also crops part of the
image that contains usable pixels.

:::info

The **image width and height** are not used to resize an existing stream. In the case of camera devices, they will act
as desired dimensions, but the component will fail to configure if they are not supported. For videos, the native
resolution should be set.

Similarly, the **frame rate** is also a request and will cause the component to fail configuration if the value
requested is not supported.

:::

:::tip

In newer versions of `CameraStreamer` you will also have access to:

- **Stream encoding**: Sets the output encoding of the image stream.

:::

Once you have selected an appropriate **source**:

1. Press **Play** to start the application.
2. To see the live camera feed, click on the gear icon on the bottom right and select **Launch RViz**.
3. In RViz, select _Add > By topic > /camera_streamer/image > Image_. This adds a panel that shows the live image. The
undistorted image (if available) can also be found under _/camera_streamer/undistorted_image > Image_.

:::info

Steps 2 and 3 are only available on Linux as they require Docker to forward graphics to the host machine. However, you
should still be able to create image streams with connected devices for further use in your application graph.

You may use the following YAML snippet containing the full application:
