# Hardware Interfaces

Hardware interfaces form the **connection layer between AICA Core and physical (or simulated) robots or sensors**. They
are responsible for exposing the robot's state and accepting control commands generated by controllers that need to be
communicated to the robot. A typical hardware interface provides the following capabilities:

- Reading joint and sensor states from the robot
- Sending position, velocity, effort, or torque commands
- Exposing General Purpose I/Os (GPIOs) and auxiliary interfaces
- Managing initialization, activation, and shutdown
- Ensuring real-time safe data exchange

All AICA hardware interfaces follow the
[`ros2_control`](/docs/product/Concepts/ros-concepts/controlling-robots) standard, ensuring compatibility and
portability across different robots and deployments.

You can refer to our [AICA Core](/docs/product/Getting-Started/intro#aica-core) introduction section for a visual
representation of where hardware interfaces come into play in the system, and to the
[Supported Hardware](/docs/product/Getting-Started/compatibility/supported-hardware) page for an overview of readily
available interfaces.

## Role in the control stack

Within the AICA control architecture, hardware interfaces sit at the **lowest level of the control stack**
(see [here](/docs/product/Getting-Started/intro#aica-core)):

- **Above** them are controllers (e.g., joint trajectory, IK, impedance, GPIO controllers)
- **Below** them is the actual robot hardware or simulator

At this level, hardware interfaces bridge **standardized ROS 2 control interfaces** and **vendor-specific robot
drivers**, allowing controllers and higher-level algorithms to operate without knowledge of the underlying hardware.

This clear separation enables control algorithms to remain **hardware-agnostic**, while hardware-specific logic stays
isolated, reusable, and easy to replace. See more information about our controllers
[here](/docs/product/Concepts/building-blocks/controllers/).

## Integration with `ros2_control`

By following the `ros2_control` framework, AICA hardware interfaces:

- Expose standardized **state and command interfaces**
- Support real-time safe update loops
- Integrate seamlessly with ROS 2 controllers and controller managers
- Work consistently across simulation and real hardware

As a result, controllers and algorithms developed in AICA Core can be reused across different robots without
modification, provided a compliant hardware interface is available.

## Supported hardware and extensibility

AICA Core supports hardware interfaces for **most major robot manipulator brands** and a range of simulators. It is also
compatible with **third-party hardware interfaces** that conform to the `ros2_control` standard.

A detailed overview of readily supported platforms is available on the
[Supported Hardware](/docs/product/Getting-Started/compatibility/supported-hardware) page.

This allows you to:

- Use existing vendor-provided or community-maintained drivers
- Integrate custom or proprietary hardware
- Switch between simulation and real hardware with minimal changes

:::note

The set of included hardware interfaces may vary depending on the license and distribution of AICA software.
If the platform you are looking for is not listed on the
[Supported Hardware](/docs/product/Getting-Started/compatibility/supported-hardware) page, please
