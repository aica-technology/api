# Hardware Interfaces

Hardware interfaces form the **connection layer between AICA Core and physical (or simulated) robots**. They are
responsible for exposing the robot's state (e.g., joint positions, velocities, efforts, GPIOs, ...) and accepting
control commands generated by controllers that need to be communicated to the robot.

All AICA hardware interfaces are implemented according to the
[`ros2_control`](../ros-concepts/controlling-robots) standard, ensuring compatibility, modularity, and portability
across different robots and deployments.

You can refer to our [AICA Core](3000/docs/product/Getting-Started/intro#aica-core) introduction section for a visual
representation of where the hardware interfaces come into play in the system.

## Role in the control stack

Within the AICA control architecture, hardware interfaces sit at the **lowest level of the control stack**:

- **Above** the hardware interface live controllers (e.g., joint trajectory, IK, impedance, GPIO controllers)
- **Below** it lies the actual robot hardware or simulator

The hardware interface translates between:

- ROS 2 control interfaces (joint state, command interfaces, GPIOs, ...)
- Vendor-specific communication protocols and real-time drivers

This clear separation allows control algorithms to remain **hardware-agnostic**, while hardware-specific logic is
isolated and reusable. See more information about our controllers
[here](/docs/product/Concepts/building-blocks/controllers/).

## Standards-based integration with `ros2_control`

By following the `ros2_control` framework, AICA hardware interfaces:

- Expose standardized **state and command interfaces**
- Support real-time safe update loops
- Integrate seamlessly with ROS 2 controllers and controller managers
- Work consistently across simulation and real hardware

As a result, controllers and algorithms developed in AICA Core can be reused across different robots without
modification, provided a compliant hardware interface is available.

## Supported hardware and extensibility

AICA Core currently supports hardware interfaces for **all major robot manipulator brands**, as well as various
simulators. In addition, AICA Core is compatible with **third-party hardware interfaces** that conform to the
`ros2_control` standard.

<!-- todo: not sure I can remove "In the future" here, in theory we need very little AICA-specific things -->
In the future, this means you will be able to:
- Use existing vendor-provided or community-maintained drivers
- Integrate custom or proprietary hardware
- Switch between simulation and real hardware with minimal changes

:::note

The set of included hardware interfaces may vary depending on the license and distribution of AICA software.

## Typical responsibilities of a hardware interface

A hardware interface typically handles:

- Reading joint and sensor states from the robot
- Sending position, velocity, effort, or torque commands
- Exposing GPIOs and auxiliary interfaces
- Managing initialization, activation, and shutdown
- Ensuring real-time safe data exchange

These responsibilities are implemented in a way that respects real-time constraints while remaining transparent to
higher-level control logic.
