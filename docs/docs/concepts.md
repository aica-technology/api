# Concepts

AICA Universe is built on open and extensible standards. This section introduces the core concepts behind the AICA
System, including its ROS integration, robotics foundations, and application building blocks. Explore the topics below
for detailed explanations to help you design and develop your own AICA applications and components.

- [ROS 2 concepts](/docs/category/ros-2-concepts): Understand how the AICA System leverages ROS, including nodes, 
  lifecycle management, URDF, TF, and dynamic composition.
- [Robotics concepts](/docs/category/robotics-concepts): Discover key robotics principles such as motion generation and
  how they are applied within the AICA System.
- [Application building blocks](/docs/category/application-building-blocks): Learn about building blocks that form the
  foundation of AICA applications.

Use these resources as a guide to deepen your understanding and accelerate your development with the AICA System.
