# YAML application syntax

The following sections define the YAML syntax used to describe an AICA application.

## Overview

An application description may contain some or all of the following top-level fields.

```yaml
on_start:
  ...

components:
  ...

hardware:
  ...

conditions:
  ...

sequences:
  ...

buttons:
  ...
```

The fields [`components`](#components) and [`hardware`](#hardware) define the main building blocks of the application.
The fields [`conditions`](#conditions) and [`sequences`](#sequences) define fine-grained application logic to
trigger [application state events](#events). The [`on_start`](#on-start)field defines a list of events to be triggered
when the application is started, while the [`buttons`](#buttons) field defines interactive buttons to manually trigger
events through the AICA developer interface.

## Events

Events drive the emergent behaviour of an application. Events can be triggered from internal application logic
through [component predicates](#predicate-events),
[conditions](#conditions), [sequences](#sequences), [UI buttons](#buttons) or
automatically [at the start of the application](#on-start). In each of these cases, events are defined in the YAML
under specific event keywords.

Read more about [events in the Concepts guide](../concepts/05-building-blocks/02-events.md).

### Load or unload a component

Components can be loaded or unloaded by component name.

```yaml
load:
  component: <component_name>
unload:
  component: <component_name>
```

It is possible to load or unload multiple components simultaneously by specifying a list of components.

```yaml
load:
  - component: component_a
  - component: component_b
```

### Transition from one component to another

Component A can invoke a transition to component B as a shorthand for "unload component A, load component B".

```yaml
transition: <component_name>
```

### Trigger a lifecycle transition

Request a lifecycle transition on the component that is triggering the event, using one of the available transitions
(`configure`, `activate`, `deactivate`, `cleanup`, or `shutdown`).

```yaml
lifecycle: activate
```

Request a lifecycle transition on a different component.

```yaml
lifecycle:
  transition: activate
  component: <component_name>
```

Use a list to trigger multiple transitions from a single predicate.

```yaml
lifecycle:
  - transition: activate
    component: <component_name>
  - transition: deactivate
    component: <component_name>
```

### Set a parameter

Set a parameter on the component that is triggering the event.

```yaml
set:
  parameter: <parameter_name>
  value: <parameter_value>
```

Set a parameter on a different component.

```yaml
set:
  parameter: <parameter_name>
  value: <parameter_value>
  component: <component_name>
```

Set a parameter on the controller of a particular hardware interface.

```yaml
set:
  parameter: <parameter_name>
  value: <parameter_value>
  controller: <controller_name>
  hardware: <hardware_name>
```

### Call a service

Call a service with no payload on the component that is triggering the event.

```yaml
call_service: <service_name>
```

Call a service on a different component.

```yaml
call_service:
  service: <service_name>
  component: <component_name>
```

Call a service with a string payload.

```yaml
call_service:
  service: <service_name>
  component: <component_name>
  payload: "..."
```

The service payload can also be written as any standard YAML object. The application parser will automatically encode
the object into a string format when making the service call. In this case, the component service is responsible
for parsing the string back into a YAML object, dict or structure as necessary.

```yaml
call_service:
  service: <service_name>
  component: <component_name>
  payload:
    foo: some content
    bar: [ x, y, z ]
    baz:
      a: 1
      b: 2
```

### Load or unload a hardware interface

Load and initialize a hardware interface.

```yaml
load:
  hardware: <hardware_name>
```

Unload and destroy a hardware interface.

```yaml
unload:
  hardware: <hardware_name>
```

### Load or unload a controller

```yaml
load:
  hardware: <hardware_name>
  controller: <controller_name>

unload:
  hardware: <hardware_name>
  controller: <controller_name>
```

Use a list to load or unload multiple controllers from a single predicate.

```yaml
load:
  - hardware: <hardware_name>
    controller: controller_a
  - hardware: <hardware_name>
    controller: controller_b
```

### Activate or deactivate a controller

Use the `switch_controllers` event to list the controllers to be activated or deactivated for a specific hardware
interface.

```yaml
switch_controllers:
  hardware: <hardware_name>
  activate: [ <controller_one>, <controller_two> ]
  deactivate: [ <controller_three>, <controller_four> ] 
```

To activate or deactivate a single controller, the controller name can be given directly instead of using a list.

```yaml
switch_controllers:
  hardware: <hardware_name>
  activate: <controller_name>
```

:::note

A controller must be loaded before it can be activated, and must be deactivated before it can be unloaded.

:::

### Manage sequences

Use the `sequence` event to either start, restart or abort a named [sequence](#sequences) in the application
description. Use the respective `start`, `restart` or `abort` fields either individually or collectively.

```yaml
sequence:
  start: <sequence_name>
  restart: <sequence_name>
  abort: <sequence_name>
```

To manage multiple sequences with the same event trigger, use a list syntax.

```yaml
sequence:
  - start: sequence_a
  - start: sequence_b
```

## Components

Components are listed under a top-level field called `components`. Component names must be unique, and should
generally follow the `lower_camel_case` naming convention.

```yaml
components:
  component_a:
    component: ...    # required
    display_name: ... # optional
    position: ...     # optional
    log_level: ...    # optional
    mapping: ...      # optional
    parameters: ...   # optional
    inputs: ...       # optional
    outputs: ...      # optional
    events: ...       # optional

  component_b:
    ...
```

Each component is defined with a number of fields, as shown below. The fields are defined in the next section.

### Component

The `component` field defines the actual component implementation to use for the component.
It takes a fully qualified class name as registered by the `RCLCPP_COMPONENTS_REGISTER_NODE` macro.

The registered class name of a component should include the package name within the namespace. For example, the
registration `foo_components::Foo` refers to a component `Foo` in package `foo_components`.

```yaml
my_component:
  component: foo_components::Foo
```

### Display name

The optional `display_name` field can be used to give the component a more human-readable name (one that does not have
to conform to the `lower_snake_case` naming convention of the YAML syntax). It is only used when rendering the component
as a node in the AICA interactive graph editor. If omitted, the name is taken directly from the YAML field (from the
previous example, it would default to `my_component`).

### Position

The `position` field is used to define the desired location of the button in the application graph. It has two subfields
defining the X and Y location, respectively.

```yaml
my_component:
  position:
    x: 100
    y: 200
```

### Log level

The `log_level` optionally sets the log severity level for this component.
Supported levels are: [unset, debug, info, warn, error, fatal]

```yaml
my_component:
  log_level: debug
```

### Mapping

The `mapping` field optionally defines overrides for the component name and namespace. Normally, the component node
is instantiated with the same name as the top level component name and put on the base namespace.

By specifying a mapping `name` or `namespace` or both, the instantiated node name is updated accordingly.

```yaml
# Without the mapping directive, the node name becomes /component_a
component_a:
  ...

# With the mapping directive, the node name becomes /my_component_namespace/my_new_component_name
component_b:
  mapping:
    name: my_new_component_name
    namespace: my_component_namespace
```

### Parameters

The `parameters` field allows initial component parameters values to be set using a `name: value` syntax. These values
are only applied when the component is loaded. To set parameter values after a component has been loaded, use the
[set parameter event](#set-a-parameter).

```yaml
my_component:
  parameters:
    my_string_parameter: my string value
    my_double_parameter: 2.0
```

#### Component rate

The `rate` parameter is a special reserved parameter that defines the step rate of a component in Hertz, which is
the inverse of the execution period.

For example, if an image processing component should run some computation at 20 frames per second, then the
rate parameter should be set to 20 Hertz.

```yaml
my_component:
  parameters:
    rate: 20
```

### Inputs and outputs

The `inputs` and `outputs` fields are used to connect component signals together to enable communication, signal
processing and control loops. Each signal is specified using a `name: value` syntax, where the name is the name
of the signal according to the component description, and the value is and the name of the signal topic.
If a component output is assigned to the same topic name as another component input, they are connected, as
illustrated in the example below.

```yaml
my_component:
  inputs:
    robot_state: /state
    applied_force: /force
  outputs:
    robot_command: /command

my_other_component:
  outputs:
    force_torque_sensor: /force
```

### Predicate events

Component predicates can be used to trigger [events](#events) by adding the named predicate and corresponding events
under the `events` field of a component definition. For example:

```yaml
my_component:
  events:
    is_active:
      load: ...
      unload: ...
    some_other_predicate_name:
      set: ...
      call_service: ...
```

#### Special event predicates

In addition to standard component predicates produced by the component at runtime, two other event triggers can be
associated with a component. These triggers are provided by the Dynamic State Engine which manages the component rather
than the component itself.

**on_load**

The `on_load` predicate is provided by the state engine and set to true after the component has been loaded. Any events
associated with the `on_load` predicate are handled after the node has been instantiated.

```yaml
component:
  events:
    on_load:
      <some triggered event>: ...
```

**on_unload**

The `on_unload` predicate is similar to the `on_load` predicate and is provided by the state engine. Any events
associated with the `on_unload` predicate are handled once the component interface has been destroyed.

```yaml
component:
  events:
    on_unload:
      <some triggered event>: ...
```

## Hardware

Hardware interfaces describe the connected robots and their corresponding controllers.

```yaml
hardware:
  robot_a:
    urdf: ...
    rate: ...
    parameters: # optional
      ...
    display_name: ... # optional
    position: ...     # optional
    controllers:
      ...
  robot_b:
    ...
```

### URDF

The `urdf` field refers to a specially formatted robot description file which defines the joint configurations and the
hardware interface driver needed to communicate with the robot.

A hardware interface can be linked to URDF file in one of the following ways:

- By name of the custom URDF uploaded to the AICA database
- By name of an example URDF included in the AICA image (available examples depend on license and distribution versions)
- By the path of a URDF file mounted in the container filesystem
- By URDF string content inserted directly in the YAML (not recommended for large files)

```yaml
# referring to a custom robot description uploaded to the user database
robot_a:
  urdf: My custom robot

# referring to a built-in robot description from the included examples
robot_b:
  urdf: Universal Robots 5e (default configuration)

# using the path to a URDF file mounted in the container filesystem
robot_c:
  urdf: /home/ros2/my_robot.urdf

# defining the URDF content in-line
robot_d:
  urdf: |
    <robot name="example">
        <ros2_control name="ExampleRobotHardwareInterface" type="system">
            <hardware>
                <plugin>robot_interface/GenericInterface</plugin>
            </hardware>
            ...
        </ros2_control>
        ...
    </robot>
```

:::info

Use the Hardware tab in the Developer Interface to manage available URDFs.

Alternatively, use the API endpoints at `/v1/data/hardware` and `/v1/examples/hardware` to manage custom hardware and
view the available built-in example URDFs, respectively.

:::

### Rate

The `rate` field defines the robot control frequency in Hz.

### Parameters

The `parameters` field is used to set hardware-specific parameter values which override the default values from the
associated URDF.

Specifically, the URDF is expected to include a `<ros2_control>` tag under which hardware properties are defined,
including the hardware plugin and any number of parameters specific to that plugin.

For example, a `robot_interface/GenericInterface` plugin may accept a `robot_ip` parameter to specify the IP address:

```xml

<robot name="example">
    <ros2_control name="ExampleRobotHardwareInterface" type="system">
        <hardware>
            <plugin>robot_interface/GenericInterface</plugin>
            <param name="robot_ip">192.168.0.1</param>
        </hardware>
        ...
    </ros2_control>
    ...
</robot>
```

By adding `robot_ip` under the `parameters` field, the default IP address can be overridden when the hardware interface
is loaded:

```yaml
my_robot:
  urdf: Example Robot
  parameters:
    robot_ip: 172.16.0.1
```

In this example, the robot interface would be loaded with the IP address of `172.16.0.1` instead of the default
`192.168.0.1` as specified in the URDF. This allows parameters to be selectively altered at deploy time directly in the
application description without needing to modify the URDF itself.

:::note

Hardware parameter values are only applied if the parameter name matches an existing hardware parameter in the URDF.
If the parameter does not exist in the URDF, it will not be added.

:::

### Display name

This optional field is identical to the [component display name](#display-name) and is used to assign a nicer,
human-readable display name to the hardware interface when rendered as a node in the AICA interactive graph editor.

### Position

This optional field is identical to the [component position](#position) and is used to provide an X, Y position for the
hardware interface when rendered as a node in the AICA interactive graph editor.

This field only affects visualization of the application graph and has no other run-time effect.
If a position is not specified, the node will be rendered at a procedurally chosen location.

### Controllers

Controllers are the interface between components in the application and hardware in the real world. They convert desired
reference signals into real joint commands according to some internal control law, and convert joint states from the
robot back to signals.

Controllers are listed under a top-level `controllers` field. Controller names must be unique within the given hardware
interface, and should generally follow the `lower_camel_case` naming convention.

Under each controller, the `plugin` field refers to a registered controller plugin name.

The `parameters` field then refers to configurable parameters for the given controller.

The `inputs` and `outputs` fields define the ROS2 topics to which each signal of the controller should be connected.
See also [Component Inputs and Outputs](#inputs-and-outputs).

Optionally, the `position` field can be used to specify an X, Y location for rendering the hardware interface
as a node in the AICA interactive graph editor. See also [Component Position](#position).

For example:

```yaml
robot:
  controllers:
    broadcaster:
      plugin: joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster
    twist_controller:
      plugin: compliant_twist_controller/CompliantTwistController
      parameters:
        linear_principle_damping: 10.0
        linear_orthogonal_damping: 10.0
        angular_stiffness: 1.0
        angular_damping: { a: 1.0, b: true }
      inputs:
        command: /motion_generator/command_output
      outputs:
        state: /recorder/state_input
```

## Conditions

Conditions are event triggers based on logical combinations of predicates.

Conditions are listed under a top-level field called `conditions`. Condition names must be unique, and should
generally follow the `lower_camel_case` naming convention.

Conditional events are triggered only on the rising edge of the condition, preventing the repeated execution of an
event if the condition stays true.

Define events to be triggered by a condition by listing them under the condition name. See the [events](#events) section
for available event syntax.

```yaml
conditions:
  condition_1:
    component: ...
    predicate: ...
    events:
      ...

  condition_2:
    <conditional_operator>: ...  # not, all, any, one_of
    events:
      ...

```

### Simple conditions

A simple condition evaluates just a single component predicate and triggers the listed events when it is true.

```yaml
condition_1:
  component: my_component
  predicate: some_component_predicate
  events:
    ...
```

### Conditional operators

To combine multiple predicates together into a single true / false condition, the following operators can be used.

The operators can refer to one or more component predicates with the syntax
`{ component: component_a, predicate: some_predicate }`

#### Not

The `not` operator takes a single item and negates its value. It is true when the item is false, and false when the
item is true.

```yaml
condition_1:
  not: { component: component_a, predicate: some_predicate }
  events:
    ...
```

#### All

The `all` operator takes a list of items and is true only when every listed item is true.

```yaml
condition_1:
  all:
    - { component: component_a, predicate: some_predicate }
    - { component: component_b, predicate: some_predicate }
  events:
    ...
```

#### Any

The `any` operator takes a list of items and is true when at least one of the listed items is true.

```yaml
condition_1:
  any:
    - { component: component_a, predicate: some_predicate }
    - { component: component_b, predicate: some_predicate }
  events:
    ...
```

#### One of

The `one_of` operator takes a list of items and is true only when exactly one of the listed items is true.

```yaml
condition_1:
  one_of:
    - { component: component_a, predicate: some_predicate }
    - { component: component_b, predicate: some_predicate }
  events:
    ...
```

### Nested conditions

The conditional operators can be applied recursively for more complex conditions. The following example could be
collapsed into the equivalent logical pseudocode: `NOT(a AND b AND (c OR d OR (e XOR f)))`

```yaml
conditions:
  nested_condition:
    not:
      all:
        - { component: component_1, predicate: a }
        - { component: component_2, predicate: b }
        - any:
            - { component: component_3, predicate: c }
            - { component: component_4, predicate: d }
            - one_of:
                - { component: component_5, predicate: e }
                - { component: component_6, predicate: f }
```

## Sequences

A sequence is a list of steps that are handled sequentially in order. Sequence steps are either
standard [state events](#events) or conditional blocks; the conditional steps are used either to wait for a condition,
predicate or fixed time interval, or to assert the current value of a condition or predicate.

Similar to [conditions](#conditions), sequences are listed under a top-level field called `sequences`. Sequence names
must be unique, and should generally follow the `lower_camel_case` naming convention.

After sequences are defined in the yaml, they can be managed using [sequence state events](#manage-sequences); component
predicates, conditions and even sequences can also start, restart or abort a sequence.

The example below uses a combination of standard event steps and conditional blocks; it asserts that a component is
active, sets a parameter on that component, waits 10 seconds, and then activates a controller.

```yaml
sequences:
  sequence_1:
    - assert:
        component: my_component
        predicate: is_active
    - set:
        component: my_component
        parameter: speed
        value: 2.0
    - wait:
        seconds: 10
    - switch_controllers:
        hardware: my_hardware
        activate: my_controller
```

### Sequence assert

The `assert` keyword is an assertion step to check if a condition or predicate is true. If the assertion succeeds,
the sequence continues to the next step. If the assertion fails, the sequence is automatically aborted.
Optionally, assertion failure can be used to trigger breakout events as a form of error handling.

The following examples show the syntax to check either a condition or component predicate respectively.

```yaml
assert:
  condition: my_condition
```

```yaml
assert:
  component: my_component
  predicate: some_predicate
```

The `else` keyword is optionally used to define breakout events if the assertion fails. The following example would
unload a component if condition `my_condition` is not true and then abort the sequence.

```yaml
assert:
  condition: my_condition
  else:
    unload:
      component: my_component
```

### Sequence wait

The `wait` keyword is used to wait for either a fixed time interval or for a condition or component predicate to be
true.

#### Waiting for a specified time interval

The simplest case is waiting for fixed duration, which uses the `seconds` field to define the time to wait in seconds.

```yaml
wait:
  seconds: 10
```

#### Waiting for a condition or predicate

The following examples show the syntax to wait for either a condition or component predicate state respectively.

```yaml
wait:
  condition: my_condition
```

```yaml
wait:
  component: my_component
  predicate: some_predicate
```

Compared to the simple fixed-time wait, a conditional wait step could block the sequence indefinitely. The `timeout`
field can be used when waiting for a condition or predicate to set a maximum time limit. The time limit is defined in
seconds with the `seconds` field.

Similar to assertions, the sequence is aborted if the wait step times out. The optional `events` keyword can be used
under the `timeout` field to define breakout events if the assertion fails. The following example would unload a
component if condition `my_condition` is not true within 10 seconds and then abort the sequence.

```yaml
wait:
  condition: my_condition
  timeout:
    seconds: 10
    events:
      unload:
        component: my_component
```

### Using sequences to manage program flow

Because sequences can also use sequence state events as steps, fine-grained looping and branching logic can be
expressed.

For example, this sequence would activate and deactivate a lifecycle component every 5 seconds in an endless loop:

```yaml
sequences:
  my_sequence:
    - lifecycle:
        component: my_component
        transition: activate
    - wait:
        seconds: 5
    - lifecycle:
        component: my_component
        transition: deactivate
    - wait:
        seconds: 5
    - sequence:
        restart: my_sequence
```

The next example starts `sequence_2` if a condition is true, and else starts `sequence_3`.

```yaml
sequences:
  sequence_1:
    - wait:
        seconds: 5
    - assert:
        condition: my_condition
        else:
          sequence:
            start: sequence_3
    - sequence:
        start: sequence_2
```

## On Start

The `on_start` keyword is reserved as a special event trigger when the application is launched.
List the [events](#events) to trigger on startup (for example, to load components and hardware interfaces).

```yaml
on_start:
  load:
    - component: component_a
    - component: component_b
    - hardware: robot_a
```

## Buttons

Buttons are interactive elements in the Developer Interface UI. They are used to manually
trigger [state events](#events) when an application is running by clicking the trigger button in the application graph.
Buttons have no effect on the application if the UI is not used.

```yaml
buttons:
  my_button:
    position: ...
    on_click:
      ...
```

### Position

This optional field is identical to the [component position](#position) and is used to provide an X, Y position for the
component when rendered as a node in the AICA interactive graph editor.

### On Click

List the [events](#events) to trigger when the button is clicked while the application is running (for example, to
unload a component).

```yaml
my_button:
  on_click:
    unload:
      component: component_a
```

## Validating a YAML application

The [YAML application schema](https://docs.aica.tech/schemas/1-2-0/application.schema.json) defines the structural rules
of an AICA application and effectively distinguishes between valid and invalid syntax.

Many modern IDEs and code editors can be configured to support custom schemas and provide in-line validation and
completion of the YAML content.

### Validating a YAML application with Visual Studio Code

Developers working with Visual Studio Code can validate YAML application files easily in two steps:

1. Install the [YAML extenstion from RedHat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)
2. Associate a schema with the YAML application by adding the following modeline to the file:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://docs.aica.tech/schemas/1-2-0/application.schema.json
```
