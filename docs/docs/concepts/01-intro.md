# Introduction

AICA is committed to making robotics more accessible by providing smart software solutions for advanced robot control.

Robotics software has many layers and comprises many different parts. The following terms are used to distinguish
between different parts of the AICA software stack.

## AICA Core

**AICA Core** is a virtual robotics workspace pre-configured with a growing collection of software libraries
for motion generation, signal processing, machine learning and control algorithms. It includes hardware interfaces for
real-time external control of popular robot brands, force-torque sensors and cameras.
The workspace is the foundation and the software libraries are the building blocks.

## AICA applications

An **application** is a particular configuration of components, controllers and hardware interfaces from the AICA
Core, generally designed to perform a particular task.

:::tip
AICA develops bespoke applications to solve specific automation challenges for clients, and offers more general smart
applications built around a particular use-case (for example, mechanical assembly) that can be re-configured in only a
few steps.

offerings.

## AICA Studio

**AICA Studio** is the user interface layer to the AICA Core that empowers developers to build and
extend their own advanced robotic applications. AICA developers use this interface internally when building custom
applications, and decided it was worth sharing with the robotics community as a stand-alone product with the following
features:

- Graphical web-based UI to dynamically edit, run and monitor AICA application
- REST API to interface with and manage AICA applications from CLI or automation cells
- Component SDK to extend the core library with custom logic and behaviors
