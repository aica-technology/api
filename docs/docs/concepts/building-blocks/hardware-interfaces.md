# Hardware interfaces

AICA hardware interfaces are implemented according to the [ros2_control](../ros-concepts/controlling-robots.md) standard,
and currently support all major brands of robot manipulators.

AICA Core is compatible with third-party hardware interfaces following the `ros2_control` standard.

:::note

The included hardware interfaces will vary depending on the license and distribution of AICA
software. [Contact us](mailto:contact@aica.tech) to learn more about available drivers.
